## My Résumé — Written in LaTeX

This repository contains the LaTeX source for my personal résumé.

I use LaTeX to write my résumé because I treat it as a piece of code — version-controlled, reproducible, and beautifully typeset. Every change in my career history is tracked just like a software project.
